#### GitHub File Download

With this tool you can directly download or create a download link to any GitHub **public directory or file**.

### Website

##### Advanced Usage

A typical download URL will look like this- `https://sk3artemis.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=<link>&fileName=<name>&rootDirectory=<true or false or name>`

In default, value of `fileName` and `rootDirectory` is set to the name of the downloading file or directory. If you do not want to add the directory itself in the zip, then set `rootDirectory=false`.
